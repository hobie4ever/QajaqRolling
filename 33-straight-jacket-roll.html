This is what I can tell you about my journey so far.</p><p>Prerequisites: <br>A strong will to succeed, the process can be a bit painful at times. <br>A qajaq that fits you, low back deck, full contact with your thighs. <br>Excellent twist in your torso (I'm not there yet)<br>An understanding of what supports you; water, shoulders, secondary stability, weight distribution inside and out. <br>You should be able to do an Elbow roll with some ease, double elbow as well. If not start there. </p><p>Yoga and stretching. YES! For me this is somewhat painful but makes all the difference. And it takes time so don't set a timetable, do what you can and things will come to you. </p><p>Qajaq: This is one of the reasons I got into SOF qajaq building, so I can build myself a qajaq which allows me to do a SJ roll. Not that the qajaq does anything for you but some attributes need to be fulfilled. My current one (TTD6 - TvångsTröja David #6 or Straight Jacket David #6) is great, built for this purpose alone. There are two issues with it, the masik is a tad too high and it's black, l loved my brown ones. The RRD5 (Rockhopping and Roll David#5) had a masik slightly lower and I had to push my knees under it, so I raised it 1 cm for TTD6 and now I regret it a bit. When I lean forward my arms touch the masik stopping me from getting low on the foredeck. This isn't a problem in forward finishing rolls since my arms are not in the way but....</p><p>The three main things I work on at the moment are:<br>Getting my shoulders flat and parallel to the surface as I reach up towards the sky before I start the backward sweep.<br>Getting my shoulders "wide" at the surface and still keep my elbows to my torso. As I push my shoulders out my hands like to slip out of my armpits and my elbows like to leave my body. It feels like a mental thing, well I'll let you know...<br>Timing! If I try to recover on the back deck too soon, the qajaq isn't passed the second stability far enough and I simply capsize it back over me. If I recover too late I don't have the righting momentum of the qajaq to pull me up the last bit to get past the tipping point. </p><p>With weight distribution I am thinking about the non-water leg. Should I push it out to the side to get a better weight distribution, counterweight or push it down to get more speed, more momentum in the qajaq? Perhaps it doesn't matter as long as I use it actively?</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on 23-01-25</p><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://qajaqrolling.com/authors/david-taeng/" rel="author">David Täng</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://qajaqrolling.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://qajaqrolling.com/01-side-sculling.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> 01 Side Sculling</a></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2023-01-24T12:55" class="feed__date">23-01-24</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://qajaqrolling.com/greenland-competiton-rolling.html">Greenland Competition Rolling</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-12-28T16:21" class="feed__date">22-12-28</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://qajaqrolling.com/this-site-is-my-x-mas-gift-from-my-oldest-son-i-plan-to-fill-it-with-greenland-rolling-images-videos-tips-failures-and-successes-skin-on-frame-builds-greenland-paddle-builds-and-design.html">This site is my x-mas gift from my oldest son.
