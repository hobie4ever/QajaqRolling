Now we're talking! This roll takes all I got, not that its all that much. If you are struggling with this roll don't be discouraged, it takes time. Look on the bright side, you must be a great roller already and if David can do it, it can't be all that hard. Right?!</p><p>For me this roll is mainly about getting out of that lovely relaxed meditative mode I'm in when I roll. I have to start using force, timing and be aggressive! Reaching out to get some support from that little surface I have in the sweep and forcefully flip the qajaq as early as possible. It's hard to have margins in this roll but to get any margins everything has to be timed and forcefully "relaxed".¬†</p><p>Life isn't fair and neither is rolling. The individuals who can do the roll makes it look easy because you can see how they are relaxed. When I try something new I usually get tense - a sure sign that a roll is going to fail. So I get all mixed up doing this roll, I have to use force and I have to be smooth and relaxed. This is very much the same as in judo practice. I've been doing Judo for 15 years and to start with I was very tense, stiff and of course got thrown a lot. To be able to perform I have to be relaxed but not passive.¬†</p><p>As you might have figured out I went through the Greenland Competition List in the pool session which I filmed so 5 seconds before the clip above I did the Clenched Fist F2F which I had to scull a bit to get up. That annoys me, shouldn't have to scull. So I'm a bit pissed off at myself when I did this one, and you can tell. It's a bit more aggressive, more power and I recovered fine. Could have been even more forcefully executed but I'm ok with this one.¬†</p><p>Judges note:¬†<br>The fingers must be closed during the entire roll.¬†</p><p>A comment about judging, I feel that Greenland Rolling isn't about winning. I always do my best and play fair, like in golf where you are your own judge most of the time.<br>Yes, you can hold the ping-pong ball with your thumb and use your fingers for sweeping support, but do you want to earn points that way? Of course not! Personally I think that the ping-pong ball is used for the uninitiated audience. I don't need it to keep my fist clenched and the judge can't see what I'm doing under water so the judge doesn't need me to hold it. On the other hand do I get a "breather" when I paddle over to get the ball and to return it so it serves some function.¬†<br>If I wanted to win I wouldn't share my path and tricks to succeed with the rolls either but if anyone get any help reading my story ...üòÉüëç¬†</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><div class="post__share"></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://qajaqrolling.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://qajaqrolling.com/26-clenched-fist-f2f.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> 26 Clenched Fist, F2F</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://qajaqrolling.com/28-clenched-fist-layback.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> 28 Clenched Fist Layback </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://qajaqrolling.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2023-02-01T15:29" class="feed__date">23-02-01</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://qajaqrolling.com/30-brick-roll-reverse-sweep.html">30 Brick Roll Reverse Sweep</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2023-01-31T16:33" class="feed__date">23-01-31</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://qajaqrolling.com/28-clenched-fist-layback.html">28 Clenched Fist Layback</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2023-01-31T15:13" class="feed__date">23-01-31</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://qajaqrolling.com/26-clenched-fist-f2f.html">26 Clenched Fist, F2F</a></h3></article></div></div><div class="post__comments"><div class="wrapper"></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Roll On!</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://qajaqrolling.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://qajaqrolling.com/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
