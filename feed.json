Now we're talking! This roll takes all I got, not that its all that much. If you are struggling with this roll don't be discouraged, it takes time. Look on the bright side, you must be a great roller already and if David can do it, it can't be all that hard. Right?!</p>\n<p>For me this roll is mainly about getting out of that lovely relaxed meditative mode I'm in when I roll. I have to start using force, timing and be aggressive! Reaching out to get some support from that little surface I have in the sweep and forcefully flip the qajaq as early as possible. It's hard to have margins in this roll but to get any margins everything has to be timed and forcefully \"relaxed\".¬†</p>\n<p>Life isn't fair and neither is rolling. The individuals who can do the roll makes it look easy because you can see how they are relaxed. When I try something new I usually get tense - a sure sign that a roll is going to fail. So I get all mixed up doing this roll, I have to use force and I have to be smooth and relaxed. This is very much the same as in judo practice. I've been doing Judo for 15 years and to start with I was very tense, stiff and of course got thrown a lot. To be able to perform I have to be relaxed but not passive.¬†</p>\n<p>As you might have figured out I went through the Greenland Competition List in the pool session which I filmed so 5 seconds before the clip above I did the Clenched Fist F2F which I had to scull a bit to get up. That annoys me, shouldn't have to scull. So I'm a bit pissed off at myself when I did this one, and you can tell. It's a bit more aggressive, more power and I recovered fine. Could have been even more forcefully executed but I'm ok with this one.¬†</p>\n<p>Judges note:¬†<br>The fingers must be closed during the entire roll.¬†</p>\n<p>A comment about judging, I feel that Greenland Rolling isn't about winning. I always do my best and play fair, like in golf where you are your own judge most of the time. <br>Yes, you can hold the ping-pong ball with your thumb and use your fingers for sweeping support, but do you want to earn points that way? Of course not! Personally I think that the ping-pong ball is used for the uninitiated audience. I don't need it to keep my fist clenched and the judge can't see what I'm doing under water so the judge doesn't need me to hold it. On the other hand do I get a \"breather\" when I paddle over to get the ball and to return it so it serves some function.¬†<br>If I wanted to win I wouldn't share my path and tricks to succeed with the rolls either but if anyone get any help reading my story ...üòÉüëç¬†</p>",

That wasn't enough for me any longer. I have to engage the \"upper\" leg as well. In the hand roll section I explained how I use my stationary hand to push. Now I also use the leg under that hand to push. I feel that I \"flip\" the qajaq around using both legs, one pull the other push combined with a turn of the hip. To have that hand on top of the gunwhale is a great support to remember to push with my leg as well. You can see that my form is much better now than in the Norsaq rolls because I have to get into the correct positions.¬†</p>\n<p>Timing! Not much more to discuss on timing more than that I need to practice in a positive way, I need to succeed with my rolls. Go back to an easier one if I fail and practice form and timing.¬†</p>\n<p>Hand position! Same here, not much more to add other than that it is of great importance to reach all the way up to the surface.¬†</p>\n<p>Now, it's ok to do some sculling as I do in the video, but what did I do \"wrong\" or less perfect?¬†<br>A number of things actually; 1. Hand not all the way to the surface. 2. Not enough force in my leg drive. 3. No actual sweep and the pry was lame to say the least.¬†</p>\n<p>Judges note:¬†<br>The fingers must be closed during the entire roll.¬†¬†</p>",

After I had succeeded with the Norsaq layback it wasn't hard to do the Hand version of it. So, do I stop my comments here... No of course not.

Not that I recommend dropping a paddle. I hold on to the tip of the paddle with my sweeping hand and do a Hand roll layback.¬†</span></p>\n<p>As I practice layback rolls I try to rely less and less on hands and arms. To come out of the water using only my torso is the ultimate goal and the Hand roll layback is a great progression. I seldom throw my non-sweeping arm over the back as a counterweight and I try to use my sweeping arm as a stabiliser. This creates a feeling of a firm core with fluttering arms.¬† As you can see in the video I almost immediately turn over on my back, trying to get my shoulders flat on the surface. This is a very active movement, not a passive float. Legs? Well yes, but they do not have to be as active as in the harder rolls, elbow/SJ but it's an opportunity to start practice using the non-water leg. More on that topic down the line.</p>\n<p>Judges note:¬†<br>The hand must be palm up during sweep and recovery.¬†</p>",

In my progression I got the Hand roll F2F rather easily but the Hand roll RS (Reverse Sweep) is another matter. Personally I went back and forth to the Norsaq RS to get the feeling and timing correct. In my opinion I find timing to be one of the most important things as I get into harder and harder rolls. From the Norsaq RS to the Hand RS is a big step in understanding what makes the roll work. Take your time as you progress and practice positively, that is succeed! If you (like I did) struggle and fail all the time you don't learn. I fail maybe twice before I go back and make an easier variant of the roll, in this case the Norsaq RS with half a norsaq extended. That way I succeed and my body and mind get positive feedback. A judo coach made a beautiful statement when he said:-\"Practice doesn't make perfect, practice makes <em>permanent</em>.\" So true in rolling as well. If I practice a sequence of motions which fail, I train my body to do the motions, not to change it into something else.¬†</p>\n<p>As with the Norsaq RS extend, reach out your sweeping hand and sweep past perpendicular. Non-sweeping hand on top of the gunwhale and push down to help turn the qajaq. Massive use of leg/thigh drive and I engage my legs as early as I possibly can. My aim (mentally) is to have the qajaq righted as I start my forward sweep and turn the qajaq even more after that. In the video above you can see that there is no stop in the rotation of my qajaq but an acceleration as my upper body gets a grip in the water. After that it's just a question of swinging my torso around and on to the front deck. üòÅ</p>\n<p>Judges note:<br>Start with the sweeping hand on the aft gunwhale.¬†¬†</p>",

No attributes, clean, swift and elegant.¬†<br>Now this isn't an easy roll, well everything can be easy once you've learned but it takes good understanding of what to do. If you leave one component out, you will keep visiting the fishes. You may have noticed that my form isn't that great in the earlier F2F or RS rolls, but now I shape up. Mainly because that with the earlier rolls I could get away with it but not on this one. So, what are MY key points for doing the whole 360 Hand roll F2F?¬†</p>\n<p>Of course all the things I previously talked about, flexibility, torso twist, leg drive, a qajaq that fits you etc. Beside this I have two key points. First to not reach out the arm perpendicular to the qajaq but at a forward angle. This gives Me a feeling of more power and it feels natural to me, perhaps since I practice it a lot. Second to push on the qajaq with my non-sweeping hand. In the video above you can see it at the very end of the roll, my thumb is still on the deck and I right the last bit of the qajaq by pushing down.¬† This helps in many ways. The major advantage is that I don't pull. If I wrap my hand around the qajaq I can stay closer to the deck, which helps, but I have a tendency to pull. If I pull I turn the qajaq the wrong way! It was hard to change my behaviour but I realised that by pushing I let my legdrive go the right way as well and increased the effect. When I pull with my non-sweeping hand I lift my non-water knee as well and the rotation stops to go the wrong way.¬†</p>\n<p>The brief visit in the face down float position which is good and (almost) necessary in the Norsaq F2F is almost gone in the Hand F2F. My feeling is that I move my head from one gunwhale at capsize to the other gunwhale at recovery. The rotation is faster in the Hand roll so there isn't much time to find the face down float. Now don't get me wrong, it's not that you can forget about it, just that it isn't obvious for me or an observer that I pass through the float.¬†</p>\n<p>Judges note:¬†<br>The non-sweeping hand can not be used to splash the surface for support. It is good form to keep it on the gunwhale.¬†</p>",

For that very reason is it a great roll to use as practice for harder rolls. Use your non sweeping hand as a counterweight to recover easier.¬† I focus on my core twist and try to do it as slowly as possible when I practice.

One of my most used rolls when in the surf and I love it but I feel I can do a lot better.¬†</p>\n<p>What did I do to make this one work? As with the forward finishing rolls there are similarities and differences but all the efforts I wrote down for the \"20. Norsaq F2F roll\" applies to the RS (Reverse Sweep) as well, and then some.¬†</p>\n<p>The reaching part is more difficult as I hold the norsaq out during the whole sweep. My hips \"click\" as I sweep from the aft position, a bit uncomfortable and strange but not dangerous but it adds to the difficulty to extend my arm with the norsaq. I personally sweep quite long, past perpendicular to the qajaq and up to around 45 degrees forward before I pry. This makes the transition to coming up a bit smoother for me as my torso is leaning forward towards the bow at the end of my sweep.¬†</p>\n<p>Leg drive and flexibility of course. I don't use the \"explosive\" drive when I get to hold a norsaq but the legdrive is forceful. I know that good teachers say that you bow with your head towards your hip on recovery. This doesn't work with my body, I have to go forward and I focus on making my nose and water knee meet. Not that I ever succeed but you understand the drive and motion.¬†</p>\n<p>Judge notes: One hand holds the norsaq, which way you want.

So, what was the code I broke?¬†</p>\n<p>First \"Chest sculling\", make chest sculling with a paddle feel easy and don't put much force on the paddle.¬†<br>Second legs, this roll is hard so no cheating to start with. I really need to drive with my water leg quite forcefully. Make sure you have contact with the foredeck in your qajaq so your drive results in a qajaq turning over.¬†<br>Third: Reach up with the norsaq all the way to the surface. That was my biggest mistake I think, not to reach with my whole body.¬†<br>Fourth: Don't stop the pry as you get low in the water, keep pushing that norsaq all the way to the keelson. It might not do much use at the bottom but some and that may give you the leverage to pass the tipping point or \"secondary stability\" for your qajaq.¬†<br>Fifth: Flexibility! I don't think I could have completed the Norsaq front to front roll if I haven't stretched my backside. I'm still not that flexible but a bit more flexible than the normal middle aged man (or beyond).¬†</p>\n<p>Judge notes: One hand holds the norsaq, which way you want.

Once I feel the avataq coming under the hull I relax my hips/lower body to stop the qajaq to start another roll. To keep the paddle in the water so I can brace is another good idea.¬†</p>\n<p>To be continued...</p>",

This is what I can tell you about my journey so far.</p>\n<p>Prerequisites:¬†<br>A strong will to succeed, the process can be a bit painful at times.¬†<br>A qajaq that fits you, low back deck, full contact with your thighs.¬†<br>Excellent twist in your torso (I'm not there yet)<br>An understanding of what supports you; water, shoulders, secondary stability, weight distribution inside and out.¬†<br>You should be able to do an Elbow roll with some ease, double elbow as well. If not start there.¬†</p>\n<p>Yoga and stretching. YES! For me this is somewhat painful but makes all the difference. And it takes time so don't set a timetable, do what you can and things will come to you.¬†</p>\n<p>Qajaq: This is one of the reasons I got into SOF qajaq building, so I can build myself a qajaq which allows me to do a SJ roll. Not that the qajaq does anything for you but some attributes need to be fulfilled. My current one (TTD6 - Tv√•ngsTr√∂ja David #6 or Straight Jacket David #6) is great, built for this purpose alone. There are two issues with it, the masik is a tad too high and it's black, l loved my brown ones. The RRD5 (Rockhopping and Roll David#5) had a masik slightly lower and I had to push my knees under it, so I raised it 1 cm for TTD6 and now I regret it a bit. When I lean forward my arms touch the masik stopping me from getting low on the foredeck. This isn't a problem in forward finishing rolls since my arms are not in the way but....</p>\n<p>The three main things I work on at the moment are:<br>Getting my shoulders flat and parallel to the surface as I reach up towards the sky before I start the backward sweep.<br>Getting my shoulders \"wide\" at the surface and still keep my elbows to my torso. As I push my shoulders out my hands like to slip out of my armpits and my elbows like to leave my body. It feels like a mental thing, well I'll let you know...<br>Timing! If I try to recover on the back deck too soon, the qajaq isn't passed the second stability far enough and I simply capsize it back over me. If I recover too late I don't have the righting momentum of the qajaq to pull me up the last bit to get past the tipping point.¬†</p>\n<p>With weight distribution I am thinking about the non-water leg. Should I push it out to the side to get a better weight distribution, counterweight or push it down to get more speed, more momentum in the qajaq? Perhaps it doesn't matter as long as I use it actively?</p>",
