Once I got used to the reverse sweep and the disorientation it provokes and now this. I felt like I was trapped in a strange bodylock the first times I tried it, I couldn't move. I had friends looking and standing in the water next to me but since they couldn't do the roll either it wasn't much help. </p>\n<p>First of all, warm up thoroughly! This roll isn't quite as bad on my joints as the Spine Roll but still... </p>\n<p>To succeed I try to get the paddle on top of the qajaq so the tip can come closer to the surface. Otherwise the sweep simply goes straight down towards the bottom of the ocean/pool. For me it's hard to lean forward as much as I would like when my hands are behind me but I try. The motion is the same as in the standard RS but still it feels awkward. I try to sweep all the way so the tip of the paddle hits the side of the qajaq way in front. To do this I let my aft hand go around my back all the way. I also struggled as I was using the wrong leg, yes this roll takes out the worst in me. I also work on the blade angle, it needs to be a bit more aggressive than normal to give me more power. <br>Besides all that it's quite a fun roll! </p>\n<p>Judges note: <br>Need to be completed with the body leaning forward. </p>",

Take care of your shoulders and warm up before trying the roll. I find that the setup is ok and the capsize but when I recover there is some overstretching and it can be slightly painful. </p>\n<p>My biggest struggle has been getting the end of the paddle caught on the gunwale as I recover. I want to push my head back into the water as my upper body gets on to the back deck and that is when the end of the paddle gets caught. Now stretch before you do this but I push my lower hand up my spine, right up between my shoulder blades. I try to set up that way because then I can get the tip of the paddle all the way down to the qajaq as i capsize which is an advantage. </p>\n<p>It is ok to hold the paddle up close to your ear at setup and the paddle can come out to almost 90 degrees at finish. You do need to return to the setup position to get full points. </p>\n<p>I would say that if your are not training for competition, consider to skip this one if you're older than 20. </p>\n<p>Judges note:<br>You cannot hold the paddle around the end. </p>",

The good news is that I can pause as I surface on the new side with the paddle pressed against the aft gunwale until I get my ups and downs straight. The sweep is really powerful if you want it to. I started with just a \"transport\" from the aft gunwale to perpendicular and then used a pry to recover. This works just fine to for the RS but with the paddle behind my back or neck it really isn't enough, I need to take advantage of the sweep. </p>\n<p>So now, many years later I try to re-learn the roll with a powerful sweep and legdrive to get the other RS rolls. </p>\n<p>As always, go both sides as soon as you get your first successful roll - it really pays off. </p>\n<p>Judges notes:<br>You need to come up with just one sweep, no sculling. </p>",

I can roll most anything with this roll, I haven't tried a canoe but a surfski worked fine. </span></p>\n<p>I was self taught but I don't recommend it to anyone. If you're not a total nerd or a Rolling Lunatic (the name of our club) you are likely to give up. On the other hand I have probably tried every mistake I can make. I would like to give you some hints but don't think that you can learn your first roll looking at and reading my post, get an instructor. </p>\n<p>Start by warming up, lean forward over your front deck, twist your torso and look backwards, arch your back. Better still, do some yoga regularly or at least stretch and twist. <br>Lean forward as far as possible, anchor your paddle to the gunwale. You can see that I don't and the paddle moves away from it's ideal position, a distraction you can do without for starters. Capsize and just be still for a second until your head is close to the surface on the new side. This is where most beginners lose it, they don't keep their tucked position over the foredeck and end up with their head as far as possible from the surface, hanging straight down. The head is heavy, keep it in the water as close to the surface for as long as possible. If you have your head close to the foredeck and thereby close to the surface you can start \"grabbing\" the water with your shoulders. That is try to lay flat on your back with the shoulders parallel to the surface. Now simply hold the paddle with your palms up with both hands close to your shoulders and sweep your body out and aft. The paddle will follow you torso as it sweeps and if you have a climbing angle of the blade the paddle will lift you closer to the surface as you turn the qajaq with your water leg. The water leg is the leg which is closest to the water or down. Your right leg if you are surfacing on the right side of the qajaq. Keep turning the qajaq as your head approaches the aft gunwale, arch your back and push your head further down into the water. Recover on the back deck with the paddle held in a high brace position, palms up. Sit up, if you feel a bit disorientated keep the tip of the paddle in the water. </p>\n<p>Judges note:<br>As in any roll you may extend the paddle as much or little as you want. Palms shall be facing up and the body shall be leaning back, preferably laying on the back deck.  </p>",

First of all I need to scull, earlier I simply used a pry go recover. To be able to scull all the way up and not rely on a pry is not hard but different and it requires other skills. Second I need to lay down over the front deck, since it's so easy I just sit straight up but that is bad form and not a low brace or chest sculling. </p>\n<p>As I teach I tell my students to keep the qajaq as flat as possible on the surface and that is good for being able to have a stable low brace. Now this manoeuvre isn't a low brace, its a chest scull. To get points for a chest scull I need to show the judge that I have complete control of my qajaq. This means that I need to tip it over passed 90 degrees and possibly more than once. I get the support from sculling, not a face down float and a pry. </p>\n<p>Finally this manoeuvre is great for practice form as the rolls get harder. A forceful leg drive, better sweep etc. </p>\n<p>Judges note: <br> The kayak must be tipped over so that at least half the deck is submerged. </p>",

I don't extend my paddle all the way but use the \"back part\" of it to cut into the water and pull myself in.

The points awarded are calculated from the straight line and I normally have to paddle next to a line in the water with distance markings. If the water is clear it can be possible to see the line and adjust my path to it. I get 1 point for the first 3 meters and 1 additional point for every two meters after that. 5 meters is 2 points, so is 6 meters. </p>\n<p>I have seen paddlers rocking the qajaq to get the paddle deeper in the water as in a sprint stroke. That is a good idea both for power and for going straight.</p>\n<p>To get a low profile under water is beneficial, lower drag, longer distance. I try to have my nose on the deck but it's hard. Hard to see where I'm going and hard because I compress my lungs. </p>\n<p>The most important aspect of this manoeuvre is to hold my breath for a looooong time. I have got some help from free divers. When I practice I rarely measure my distance, more counting the seconds or strokes I make. Counting strokes are easier, seconds have a tendency for me to speed up as I get a bit stressed under water. </p>\n<p>Practice paddling upside down! There are a lot of points go gain and it's not very difficult. It can be worth as much as a Straight Jacket Roll...

Not as hard as the forward finishing clenched fist and brick rolls but still. </p>\n<p>Have a look at the preparations working up to the Brick roll Layback - they are the same as to the elbow roll and then some. </p>\n<p>When I started trying the elbow roll I was amazed at how much lift I do get using my hand or fist. Not only is that lift gone in the elbow roll but there is a another more subtle difficulty. As I put my hand on the back of my head it is much harder for me to arch back. This is mostly a mental thing but also a bit of flexibility of the shoulder. When I try arching my head back in this position my elbow like to come forward. This means to me that I need to actively push my elbow out and down during the little sweep I can get. Don't get me wrong, I don't mean to push the elbow down for support like I can get from a paddle, just push it out so it lays parallel to the surface and don't point to the sky. If you push it down for support it will sink and our shoulders will knife. </p>\n<p>My arching is more pronounced and I use both my legs to turn the qajaq. I've mentioned it several times before and I have a different feeling when using both legs in lay back versus forward finishing rolls. In lay back rolls I try to push my non-water leg out, like out to the gunwhale, in forward finishing rolls I push it down, like to the bottom of the qajaq. I've found it easier to push the non-water leg out in lay back rolls as I can arch my back more, or at least it feels easier. In forward finishing i crunch my abs in this position and pushing the non-water leg down is ok. I find more momentum with my legs pushing down if the timing is right. </p>\n<p>As in all rolls, don't raise your head out of the water until last. I have good momentum in the roll in the video so I get away with it. </p>\n<p>Strangely enough I set up very differently in the elbow roll than in all the other lay back rolls. I twist my torso so I face sideways, point the elbow forward and capsize. It feels like doing a face-plant into the water. Most people try to lean forward close to the fore deck and I guess that's fine but it doesn't work for me. </p>\n<p>Lastly, hold your position - facing sideways or forward until your nose get very close to the surface before you un-tuck and sweep your torso. </p>\n<p>Judges note: The hand shall stay on the back of your head throughout the whole roll. It is ok to use the other arm as counterweight. </p>",
