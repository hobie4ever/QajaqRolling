I'm still working on all of my reverse sweep rolls, even the ones with a paddle. I guess my body hasn't found the optimum position, my sweep hasn't found the correct climbing angle. Oh, yes I can do them but the reverse sweep had a love/hate place in my heart. One of my most used rolls when in the surf and I love it but I feel I can do a lot better. </p>\n<p>What did I do to make this one work? As with the forward finishing rolls there are similarities and differences but all the efforts I wrote down for the \"20. Norsaq F2F roll\" applies to the RS (Reverse Sweep) as well, and then some. </p>\n<p>The reaching part is more difficult as I hold the norsaq out during the whole sweep. My hips \"click\" as I sweep from the aft position, a bit uncomfortable and strange but not dangerous but it adds to the difficulty to extend my arm with the norsaq. I personally sweep quite long, past perpendicular to the qajaq and up to around 45 degrees forward before I pry. This makes the transition to coming up a bit smoother for me as my torso is leaning forward towards the bow at the end of my sweep. </p>\n<p>Leg drive and flexibility of course. I don't use the \"explosive\" drive when I get to hold a norsaq but the legdrive is forceful. I know that good teachers say that you bow with your head towards your hip on recovery. This doesn't work with my body, I have to go forward and I focus on making my nose and water knee meet. Not that I ever succeed but you understand the drive and motion. </p>\n<p>Judge notes: One hand holds the norsaq, which way you want. The other hand may not be used to push or slap the water, good form is to keep the non-sweeping hand along the gunnel.</p>",

In my opinion the F2F Norsaq roll is the entrance to the difficult set of rolls. I tried and tried and failed and failed for the better part of a summer. Then I got it! Lost it, got it again. Now I consider it quite easy which can explain my bad form in the video above. I really don't need to force anything since I got my basics right. So, what was the code I broke? </p>\n<p>First \"Chest sculling\", make chest sculling with a paddle feel easy and don't put much force on the paddle. <br>Second legs, this roll is hard so no cheating to start with. I really need to drive with my water leg quite forcefully. Make sure you have contact with the foredeck in your qajaq so your drive results in a qajaq turning over. <br>Third: Reach up with the norsaq all the way to the surface. That was my biggest mistake I think, not to reach with my whole body. <br>Fourth: Don't stop the pry as you get low in the water, keep pushing that norsaq all the way to the keelson. It might not do much use at the bottom but some and that may give you the leverage to pass the tipping point or \"secondary stability\" for your qajaq. <br>Fifth: Flexibility! I don't think I could have completed the Norsaq front to front roll if I haven't stretched my backside. I'm still not that flexible but a bit more flexible than the normal middle aged man (or beyond). </p>\n<p>Judge notes: One hand holds the norsaq, which way you want. The other hand may not be used to push or slap the water, good form is to keep the non-sweeping hand along the gunnel. </p>\n<p>A view of how that summer looked like, and this was a good attempt. </p>\n<figure class=\"post__video\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"314\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/K_lTE9fCW7Y\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></figure>",

I simply love the catapult when my friend get shot back into the water, thank you for letting me use the footage Johanna. <br>As you can see in the sequence above the hard part is twofold, the first to get the avataq (hunting float) around the bottom of the qajaq and then to make sure you don't fall over as it does. </p>\n<p>It's not a really hard roll if you have the correct body mechanics in place but if you try it using your paddle only to complete the roll you will find yourself in trouble. A lot of lower body movement to get the qajaq to complete slightly more than 360 degrees rotation. Once I feel the avataq coming under the hull I relax my hips/lower body to stop the qajaq to start another roll. To keep the paddle in the water so I can brace is another good idea. </p>\n<p>To be continued...</p>",

This is what I can tell you about my journey so far.</p>\n<p>Prerequisites: <br>A strong will to succeed, the process can be a bit painful at times. <br>A qajaq that fits you, low back deck, full contact with your thighs. <br>Excellent twist in your torso (I'm not there yet)<br>An understanding of what supports you; water, shoulders, secondary stability, weight distribution inside and out. <br>You should be able to do an Elbow roll with some ease, double elbow as well. If not start there. </p>\n<p>Yoga and stretching. YES! For me this is somewhat painful but makes all the difference. And it takes time so don't set a timetable, do what you can and things will come to you. </p>\n<p>Qajaq: This is one of the reasons I got into SOF qajaq building, so I can build myself a qajaq which allows me to do a SJ roll. Not that the qajaq does anything for you but some attributes need to be fulfilled. My current one (TTD6 - TvångsTröja David #6 or Straight Jacket David #6) is great, built for this purpose alone. There are two issues with it, the masik is a tad too high and it's black, l loved my brown ones. The RRD5 (Rockhopping and Roll David#5) had a masik slightly lower and I had to push my knees under it, so I raised it 1 cm for TTD6 and now I regret it a bit. When I lean forward my arms touch the masik stopping me from getting low on the foredeck. This isn't a problem in forward finishing rolls since my arms are not in the way but....</p>\n<p>The three main things I work on at the moment are:<br>Getting my shoulders flat and parallel to the surface as I reach up towards the sky before I start the backward sweep.<br>Getting my shoulders \"wide\" at the surface and still keep my elbows to my torso. As I push my shoulders out my hands like to slip out of my armpits and my elbows like to leave my body. It feels like a mental thing, well I'll let you know...<br>Timing! If I try to recover on the back deck too soon, the qajaq isn't passed the second stability far enough and I simply capsize it back over me. If I recover too late I don't have the righting momentum of the qajaq to pull me up the last bit to get past the tipping point. </p>\n<p>With weight distribution I am thinking about the non-water leg. Should I push it out to the side to get a better weight distribution, counterweight or push it down to get more speed, more momentum in the qajaq? Perhaps it doesn't matter as long as I use it actively?</p>",

It's easy to start cheating, not using your complete range of motion and the tools available. <br>To get a 2 point score you need to show the judge that you have control of yourself and your qajaq. At least one shoulder in the water and tip the qajaq up to at least 90 degrees. Correct, you don't try to tip the qajaq over but to keep it flat in normal conditions but this is competition. Give the judge all you can so the scoring is easy, full 2 points per side. </p>\n<p>As you practice, try to get both shoulders, your entire torso in the water, get your eyebrows wet, keep one hand \"still\" over your shoulder, sweep wide and slow. My example may not be the greatest but I'm practising. </p>",

Second, as I have grasped the use of the words, a qajaq is a traditional skin on frame kayak even if it hasn't been skinned with sealskin. A kayak can are normally built in other materials such as plastics, carbon fibre etc. A \"kayak\" with some may call \"recreational\" isn't really a qajaq - it looks a bit like a kayak but there is a Greenlandic word -\"qarariaq\" - what I think means \"like a qajaq\" or \"almost a qajaq\". To call a kayak a \"boat\" is not correct in my opinion. Not that it's wrong but a qajaq is a traditional hunting tool, and together with the dogsled are the two most important tools for surviving. So to honour the arctic culture and all the people who died while hunting in a qajaq I hope I do the right thing. Thirdly - it looks beautiful \"Qajaq\"! </p>",

Selling wasn't an easy task, the qajaq is \"mine\" for a number of reasons, nothing adjustable, no seat, no backrest, no hatches, no room for gear. My legs and knees determine the fixed positions of the footrest and masik and thighsupport so the person buying it need to be able to fit. I put out ads summer and autumn but a very mild response. Eventually I built a D3 and I ended up giving the D2 away to a friend. After all, it has been frequently used year around for four years and is a very special qajaq. But the advertising had reached a small group of interested people, more to come... </p>\n<p>A short video where I fail a F2F norsaq toll in my D2 qajaq. </p>\n<figure class=\"post__video\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"314\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/K_lTE9fCW7Y\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></figure>\n<figure class=\"post__video\">\n<figure class=\"post__video\">\n<figure class=\"post__video\"></figure>\n</figure>\n</figure>",

My first attempt and it was really all that I'd hoped for. Soo proud. <br>Built in my garage out of Spruce and Ash, ash for bending stock. I used the book \"Building the Greenland kayak\" by Christoffer Cunningham and I guess I spent 80 h building it and 80 h reading to understand everything in English, not the vocabulary you learn in school. The cloth was from Extreme Textile, nylon and the varnish Zar one part PU. I dyed it with stone pigment so the colour will stay as i took care to get UV protcective varnish as well. </p>\n<p>I brought it to a pool session in january 2017 and a guy there looked me up and asked if he could buy it. I had by this time already got some ideas for minor changes so I agreed on the condition that I finish my second one before delivery so I could copy most of the D1. Sorry to say the guy backed out on me so I had two custom build qajaqs build for my skinny tall body. But if he hadn't asked to buy it I may not have started to build as many as I have so thanks anyway.  </p>",
