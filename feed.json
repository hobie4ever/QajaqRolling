I never found that to be the same movements or feeling so that doesn't help me. In the worst case I ruin a powerful Storm roll. I did try a lot of different ways to practice this roll but in the end I found that what I need is a powerful scull and not much more. As previously stated: Sculling is Sculling is Sculling (-Turner Wilson).</p>\n<p>My path to the Sculling with the paddle held horizontal on foredeck went through Chest Sculling and then simply by doing the full Sculling roll. I remember the first time I got this roll - I was so surprised that it was so easy! And then I couldn't do it again for weeks... As I practice my Chest sculling I notice that the speed of the paddle through the water is quite slow to get a powerful scull. I also notice that the blade angle is much more aggressive than during a sweep. As I had only done successful sweeps previously this is a game changer. To get a good scull in one direction is ok, but to have it both ways is the trick. This requires a big change in the blade angle, about 90 degrees. If I go too fast or have narrow sculls I don't get the benefit of the great power a good scull can produce.</p>\n<p>To get full points I need to scull at least 4-5 times and keep the paddle as perpendicular to the qajaq as possible. </p>\n<p>Judges note:<br> The paddle shall be held close to perpendicular on the deck of the qajaq.</p>",

As I discussed in the post for chest sculling most people don't scull at first when they lay on the belly, just pry. When I realised that I did just that, pry while I should be chest sculling I went back and started over. That helped me to develop a powerful scull, and frankly sculling is sculling as Turner Wilson stated. Sculling is a bit different from sweeping back and forth, I go a bit faster and use a lot more blade angle. When I fail it is almost always the same mistake, too fast, not wide enough and not aggressive enough blade angle. It is a bit hard to practice but chest sculling and then vertical sculling \"roll\" is my way to go. </p>\n<p>There are some variations to this roll so be sure to check and double check the rules in your country! <br>First variation is to actually roll all the way. This is a bit easier but also more disorientating. I can use the momentum of the capsize to get up on the other side. I personally haven't practised this very much and I have problems twisting the paddle to come into the sculling/recovery position.  <br>Second is how to hold your hands. Palms in or palms out. Cheri and Turner teach palms out in their amazing video \"This is the Roll 2\" so that was the way I first learned. It makes for a rather smooth forward finish recovery. If I hold my palms out the starting position feels very familiar and is a draw stroke or bow rudder or sculling for going sideways. The sculling also feels more powerful, but forward recovery is difficult so I tend to come up almost straight. I don't think the palm in our out makes much difference to how hard the roll is so practice both if your rules don't state exactly how to score. </p>\n<p>Judges note: (Swedish rules!)<br>Up and down on the same side. Palms in or out doesn't matter but the paddle can not deviate from vertical more than normal wiggle. </p>\n<p><br><em>(Another rule set: Palms out at setup, palms in at recovery. 360 degree roll, capsize on one side and recover on the other.)</em></p>",

It is hard to move in this position so I have found two things important to complete this roll. </p>\n<p>First to have control over my head and thereby the blade angle during the sweep. I have a tendency to bow down into the water early in reverse sweep rolls and if I do that here the blade angle will make the paddle dive. So keep your head up until the end of the sweep. </p>\n<p>Second; I find a pry at the end helpful and the pry in this roll goes the \"wrong\" way, I push the paddle out, away from the qajaq. That is why do not place the end of the blade on the neck in the setup. See, I got 50 cm or so to pry with if I need it as I do in the second/outdoor roll in the video above.</p>\n<p>As the body position is very strange in this roll (as well) I sometimes use the non-water leg instead of the water leg to raise and then the roll becomes a muscle struggle and usually fail. <br>When everything falls into place the roll is quite easy as the paddle gives you tremendous power to get up. </p>\n<p>Judges note:<br>It's ok to take your time capsizing. </p>",

Once I got used to the reverse sweep and the disorientation it provokes and now this. I felt like I was trapped in a strange bodylock the first times I tried it, I couldn't move. I had friends looking and standing in the water next to me but since they couldn't do the roll either it wasn't much help. </p>\n<p>First of all, warm up thoroughly! This roll isn't quite as bad on my joints as the Spine Roll but still... </p>\n<p>To succeed I try to get the paddle on top of the qajaq so the tip can come closer to the surface. Otherwise the sweep simply goes straight down towards the bottom of the ocean/pool. For me it's hard to lean forward as much as I would like when my hands are behind me but I try. The motion is the same as in the standard RS but still it feels awkward. I try to sweep all the way so the tip of the paddle hits the side of the qajaq way in front. To do this I let my aft hand go around my back all the way. I also struggled as I was using the wrong leg, yes this roll takes out the worst in me. I also work on the blade angle, it needs to be a bit more aggressive than normal to give me more power. <br>Besides all that it's quite a fun roll! </p>\n<p>Judges note: <br>Need to be completed with the body leaning forward. </p>",

I want to push my head back into the water as my upper body gets on to the back deck and that is when the end of the paddle gets caught.
