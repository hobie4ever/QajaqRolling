<p>The Reverse Sweep is also a great roll, love it. <br>When I started to learn the RS I had problem with disorientation. The good news is that I can pause as I surface on the new side with the paddle pressed against the aft gunwale until I get my ups and downs straight. The sweep is really powerful if you want it to. I started with just a "transport" from the aft gunwale to perpendicular and then used a pry to recover. This works just fine to for the RS but with the paddle behind my back or neck it really isn't enough, I need to take advantage of the sweep. </p>
<p>So now, many years later I try to re-learn the roll with a powerful sweep and legdrive to get the other RS rolls. </p>
<p>As always, go both sides as soon as you get your first successful roll - it really pays off. </p>
<p>Judges notes:<br>You need to come up with just one sweep, no sculling. </p>

<p>I love this roll!</p>
<p>When I learned the Storm Roll I focused on moving my head from one gunwale to the other and pushing the paddle with my aft hand. In the beginning i found the forward crunching position a bit strange but now I love getting low. </p>
<p>Last summer (2022) I fulfilled my dream in line of applied rolling. I faced a wave of about 2-3 meters about to break on top of me. Ok I put myself in that position so I was prepared. I rolled over before the wave hit and got the force of water on the bottom, made a storm roll and paddled to meet the next wave. Nothing dramatic as all went smooth but I was thrilled to carry it out. </p>
<p>If I get knocked over at sea and have a bit of time to prepare I almost always go for the storm roll, fun, fast and reliable. </p>
<p>Judges note:<br>The wrists shall be over the paddle, palms down. The force face on the paddle cannot be changed. </p>

<p>The Paddle held in the Crook of Arm roll is very similar to the SGR-Standard Greenland Roll. Everything is the same and feels the same as long as I've managed to capsize. It took a while until I could twist my body far enough to be able to hook the paddle on the gunwale. It helps a bit to fix the paddle at the gunwale during capsize and rotation but if you can't get all the way over it's ok to swing the paddle across the qajaq as you capsize. </p>
<p>Judges note:<br>Only one hand can touch the paddle. </p>

I can roll most anything with this roll, I haven't tried a canoe but a surfski worked fine. </span></p>
<p>I was self taught but I don't recommend it to anyone. If you're not a total nerd or a Rolling Lunatic (the name of our club) you are likely to give up. On the other hand I have probably tried every mistake I can make. I would like to give you some hints but don't think that you can learn your first roll looking at and reading my post, get an instructor. </p>
<p>Start by warming up, lean forward over your front deck, twist your torso and look backwards, arch your back. Better still, do some yoga regularly or at least stretch and twist. <br>Lean forward as far as possible, anchor your paddle to the gunwale. You can see that I don't and the paddle moves away from it's ideal position, a distraction you can do without for starters. Capsize and just be still for a second until your head is close to the surface on the new side. This is where most beginners lose it, they don't keep their tucked position over the foredeck and end up with their head as far as possible from the surface, hanging straight down. The head is heavy, keep it in the water as close to the surface for as long as possible. If you have your head close to the foredeck and thereby close to the surface you can start "grabbing" the water with your shoulders. That is try to lay flat on your back with the shoulders parallel to the surface. Now simply hold the paddle with your palms up with both hands close to your shoulders and sweep your body out and aft. The paddle will follow you torso as it sweeps and if you have a climbing angle of the blade the paddle will lift you closer to the surface as you turn the qajaq with your water leg. The water leg is the leg which is closest to the water or down. Your right leg if you are surfacing on the right side of the qajaq. Keep turning the qajaq as your head approaches the aft gunwale, arch your back and push your head further down into the water. Recover on the back deck with the paddle held in a high brace position, palms up. Sit up, if you feel a bit disorientated keep the tip of the paddle in the water. </p>
<p>Judges note:<br>As in any roll you may extend the paddle as much or little as you want. Palms shall be facing up and the body shall be leaning back, preferably laying on the back deck.  </p>

<p>I thought chest sculling was a piece of cake, then I started checking what I need to do to get the two points. First of all I need to scull, earlier I simply used a pry go recover. To be able to scull all the way up and not rely on a pry is not hard but different and it requires other skills. Second I need to lay down over the front deck, since it's so easy I just sit straight up but that is bad form and not a low brace or chest sculling. </p>
<p>As I teach I tell my students to keep the qajaq as flat as possible on the surface and that is good for being able to have a stable low brace. Now this manoeuvre isn't a low brace, its a chest scull. To get points for a chest scull I need to show the judge that I have complete control of my qajaq. This means that I need to tip it over passed 90 degrees and possibly more than once. I get the support from sculling, not a face down float and a pry. </p>
<p>Finally this manoeuvre is great for practice form as the rolls get harder. A forceful leg drive, better sweep etc. </p>
<p>Judges note: <br> The kayak must be tipped over so that at least half the deck is submerged. </p>

<p>By now you have probably have a reliable Greenland Standard Roll. Normally I try to do my rolls as slow as possible to develop my technique but this is different. Nothing to it? Well if you are satisfied with 3 rolls in 10 seconds fine, no extra info needed. I have seen 6 rolls and that is amazing and it can win you the competition.</p>
<p>So yes there are a couple of tricks to get to five or six. <br>First of all, I chase that surface with my head, keep as low to the qajaq as I can. I usually don't lean all the way forward while above water but as I get into the wet I crunch. I have to twist my torso as well, it helps me to get out of the water.</p>
<p>Second, the paddle sweep is quite different. I don't extend my paddle all the way but use the "back part" of it to cut into the water and pull myself in. It feels much the same as when I started to learn Sculling rolls, the first "slashing" of the paddle to get deep. When I get it right, and it is hard to get the correct angle of the blade together with the right force and speed, it really speeds up my capsize. </p>
<p>Judges note: <br>The time start when the head hits the water and a roll is considered complete when the head comes out of the water. </p>

<p>This manoeuvre is pretty straight forward. I put my paddle under the qajaq, capsize and go. Now there are a few hint to be able to go far...</p>
<p>First of all - go straight! The points awarded are calculated from the straight line and I normally have to paddle next to a line in the water with distance markings. If the water is clear it can be possible to see the line and adjust my path to it. I get 1 point for the first 3 meters and 1 additional point for every two meters after that. 5 meters is 2 points, so is 6 meters. </p>
<p>I have seen paddlers rocking the qajaq to get the paddle deeper in the water as in a sprint stroke. That is a good idea both for power and for going straight.</p>
<p>To get a low profile under water is beneficial, lower drag, longer distance. I try to have my nose on the deck but it's hard. Hard to see where I'm going and hard because I compress my lungs. </p>
<p>The most important aspect of this manoeuvre is to hold my breath for a looooong time. I have got some help from free divers. When I practice I rarely measure my distance, more counting the seconds or strokes I make. Counting strokes are easier, seconds have a tendency for me to speed up as I get a bit stressed under water. </p>
<p>Practice paddling upside down! There are a lot of points go gain and it's not very difficult. It can be worth as much as a Straight Jacket Roll... (23 meters = 11 points)</p>
<p>Judges note: The distance is measured along the straight marked line. </p>

<p>The elbow roll is quite a bit more difficult than the previous lay back rolls. Not as hard as the forward finishing clenched fist and brick rolls but still. </p>
<p>Have a look at the preparations working up to the Brick roll Layback - they are the same as to the elbow roll and then some. </p>
<p>When I started trying the elbow roll I was amazed at how much lift I do get using my hand or fist. Not only is that lift gone in the elbow roll but there is a another more subtle difficulty. As I put my hand on the back of my head it is much harder for me to arch back. This is mostly a mental thing but also a bit of flexibility of the shoulder. When I try arching my head back in this position my elbow like to come forward. This means to me that I need to actively push my elbow out and down during the little sweep I can get. Don't get me wrong, I don't mean to push the elbow down for support like I can get from a paddle, just push it out so it lays parallel to the surface and don't point to the sky. If you push it down for support it will sink and our shoulders will knife. </p>
<p>My arching is more pronounced and I use both my legs to turn the qajaq. I've mentioned it several times before and I have a different feeling when using both legs in lay back versus forward finishing rolls. In lay back rolls I try to push my non-water leg out, like out to the gunwhale, in forward finishing rolls I push it down, like to the bottom of the qajaq. I've found it easier to push the non-water leg out in lay back rolls as I can arch my back more, or at least it feels easier. In forward finishing i crunch my abs in this position and pushing the non-water leg down is ok. I find more momentum with my legs pushing down if the timing is right. </p>
<p>As in all rolls, don't raise your head out of the water until last. I have good momentum in the roll in the video so I get away with it. </p>
<p>Strangely enough I set up very differently in the elbow roll than in all the other lay back rolls. I twist my torso so I face sideways, point the elbow forward and capsize. It feels like doing a face-plant into the water. Most people try to lean forward close to the fore deck and I guess that's fine but it doesn't work for me. </p>
<p>Lastly, hold your position - facing sideways or forward until your nose get very close to the surface before you un-tuck and sweep your torso. </p>
<p>Judges note: The hand shall stay on the back of your head throughout the whole roll. It is ok to use the other arm as counterweight. </p>

<p>The Brick roll Layback is mostly a mental difficulty. If you can pull off a layback hand roll this should not be too hard. Is it worth 9 points, well....</p>
<p>What I needed to work on progressing from the layback hand roll to the rock/brick roll are a few things.<br>1. Start with the side sculling. Yes, the first manoeuvre on the list! Now I need to get both shoulders in the water, really arch my back to push my head down backwards into the water. I also do static brace using my free hand to push me further out from the qajaq. With a low volume qajaq as mine I don't need a paddle to do this but it feels good to have it at hand. In the floating position on my back I try to swing my upper body from as close to 90 degrees to the qajaq to my head touching the aft gunwale back and fourth simulating the body sweep in the layback roll. <br>2. When holding a 4 kg (ladies 3 kg) rock in my hand I don't want to put strain on my shoulder. To avoid that I hold the rock rather close to the gunwale and when I sweep my body simply let the rock drop. This will also put my arm in a awkward position pointing straight down in the water as l lay on the back deck. If I push the rock down I find that I stretch my shoulder badly and the momentum of the rock can pull me over. </p>
<p>That's if folks...</p>
<p>Judges note: It is ok to push the rock under the kayak as you complete the roll, and lift it out of the water as you sit up.   </p>

<p>The Brick roll Reverse Sweep has very much in common with the front to front brick roll so please read what I had to say about that first. I will mainly comment on differences here. </p>
<p>I find the Brick roll Reverse Sweep a bit harder than the Brick roll Front to Front since I haven't found how to use the sweep in an effective way. I simply move my body to the pry position as in the front to front roll and hope for the best. I need to practice getting more power out of the sweep, or maybe it's just how I feel when doing it? </p>
<p>My main challenge is to keep the brick/rock high in the water so it is at the surface as I reach the pry position, or "face down float". Not that there is much "float" holding a 4 kg rock over my head. If I succeed with the rock position I usually succeed, but as previously stated, there are no margins for errors. I try to use my legs to hold a "pressure" in my qajaq as i sweep and then as I push the rock down, crunch my abs and try to get my nose to my knee I want to really flip the qajaq to upright. Here's where an old guys anatomy can get in the way once in a while, to both lay "flat" with my shoulders on the surface and get my hips turned to be able to crunch. I get stuck from time to time, there is no way I can pull this roll off without a good warming up. </p>
<p>As always I'm not quite happy with my form in the video above but I got up, didn't I? <br>A little sculling at the end, well the roll would be accepted but depending on the judge a point may be taken off. </p>
<p>Judges note: Start holding the brick at the rear gunwale.</p>
