<p>I started out with europaddles as I didn't know anything else. As I started looking for "my" feeling of both kayak and paddle I rather soon discovered greenland paddles. Last year I tried to paddle a europaddle again as I was playing in the surf but no... Can't and won't try to find the technique or feeling again. I'm lost to the GP and happy about it. I make my own but I love to try other GPs as well. Recently got to try one from Anders Thygesen, Norwegian Wood, and it was super! Back to the workshop and try to find what made Anders paddle work its way through the water in such a lovely way. That will be experiment number 32, yes I brand them and keep count just for fun.¬†</p>

                <p>Oh how I love the extremely low volume East Greenland qajaqs. Why do I write "qajaq" and not kayak? Well, first because I'm a nerd üòÅ. Second, as I have grasped the use of the words, a qajaq is a traditional skin on frame kayak even if it hasn't been skinned with sealskin. A kayak can are normally built in other materials such as plastics, carbon fibre etc. A "kayak" with some may call "recreational" isn't really a qajaq - it looks a bit like a kayak but there is a greenlandic word -"qarariaq" - what I think means "like a qajaq" or "almost a qajaq". To call a kayak a "boat" is not correct in my opinion. Not that it's wrong but a qajaq is a traditional hunting tool, and together with the dogsled are the two most important tools for surviving. So to honour the arctic culture and all the people who died while hunting in a qajaq I hope I do the right thing. Thirdly - it looks beautiful "Qajaq"!¬†</p>

<p>A friend asked to buy the D1 so I started building a "copy". Of course there are some modifications as you can see on the images. The cockpit is smaller and the masik sits a bit higher. Yes, the D2 isn't quite finished in the images above, the deckriggings are missing. I loved this qajaq and paddled it for four years.¬†</p>
